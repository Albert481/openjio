## Motivation

Thanks to advancements in technology, it is now easier to communicate with people than ever before. Smartphones, social media platforms, and the internet have made it possible to reach out to anyone, anywhere, at any time. However, despite these convenience, studies have shown that people are feeling more isolated and lonely than ever, with seniors experiencing higher levels of loneliness compared to other age groups. 

I have been wondering what would my parents do after their retirement. I cannot imagine them watching television or scrolling through social media apps for their remaining years. A social app specifically designed for elderly people staying at home could provide a valuable resource for these individuals to connect with others and combat feelings of loneliness and isolation. An easy-to-use app could provide a safe and convenient way for elderly individuals to engage with others and maintain their social connections.
